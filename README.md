random-demodulator
==================

MATLAB code for the random demodulator and constrained random demodulator

The script 'RDsims.m' is self-contained code that only relies on calling YALL1
(http://yall1.blogs.rice.edu) and SpaRSA (http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/SpaRSA/) as external
dependencies.  The scripts 'RDsims_BP.m' and 'RDsims_Lass.m' are used to run the noiseless
and noisy simulations, respectively.  The other scripts contain the dependent functions.
