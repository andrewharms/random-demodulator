random-demodulator
==================

MATLAB code for the random demodulator and constrained random demodulator

The script 'RDsims.m' is self-contained code that only relies on calling YALL1 and SpaRSA
as external dependencies.  The scripts 'RDsims_BP.m' and 'RDsims_Lass.m' are used to run
the noiseless and noisy simulations, respectively.  The other scripts contain the
dependent functions.
